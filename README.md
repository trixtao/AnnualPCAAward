# AnnualPCAAward
A collection of statistics regarding Philippine WCA competitions by the request of sir Yuji Yoshida.

## How to use these queries in the WCA Statistics website? 

If you own a WCA account, you can visit the [statistics.worldcubeassociation.org](https://statistics.worldcubeassociation.org/) website[^2] and either compute your own queries or use one of mine from this repository. 

- Log into the WCA account
- Go to the *Database Query* section
- Copy and paste the code from the desired query
- Voila! Watanays
